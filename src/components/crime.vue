<!--order of a vue component is the general html, then the javascript with everything in an object? with the general order of data,
methods, computed. 

Overall setup of this site is that every single question needed to determine eligibility for expungement is in correct order in html.
Only the first question, next question to be answered, and answered questions are visible (to make it impossible to answer questions
out of order or ones that are unnecessary based on those previously answered).

Which question to reveal is determined by "paths" hardcoded into the methods section (probably should throw those in data).
A path is the questions and the associated answers that lead to the possibility of expungement. 
Every time an answer is selected, a method is run that checks all answered questions/values selected and compares it to a path.
If the examined path matches the answers so far, the next question on that path is revealed, if not, another path is checked.

If no path matches, a method is run that looks for questions/answers that mean a charge is not eligible for expungement, if there is a match
a pop up explains why the charge is not eligible.

If the end of a path is reached (meaning all answered questions/answers match the entire path) a method is run that takes the dates that have
been input and determines when the charge will be eligible for expungement, and displays a pop up with that information. -->
